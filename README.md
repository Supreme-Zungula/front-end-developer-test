# front-end-developer-test

This is the starter code for a to-do list CRUD app, the app includes an API with HTTP methods, request parameters, and response formats. The API allows you to perform create, read, update, and delete operations on to-do items.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```
Use the official vue docs for reference https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html

```sh
Make sure you have the latest version of Node installed.
```
```sh
Fork the Repository: Start by forking the repository by clicking the "Fork" button. 
This creates a copy of the repository under your own account.
```
```sh
Clone the Repository: Go to your Github account and select the repository. 
Next, clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git by running the
command git clone <forked_repository_url>
```
```sh
Create a New Branch: Create a new branch in your local repository to work on the changes. 
For example, you can create a new branch called "my-name" using the command git checkout -b my-name
```
```sh
Make Changes: Make the necessary changes to the codebase in your local branch. 
Be sure to follow the Exigent's contribution guidelines and coding standards.
```
```sh
Commit Changes: Once the changes are made, commit them with a meaningful 
commit message using the command git commit -m "Add my feature"
```
```sh
Push Changes: Push the changes to your forked repository using the command git push origin my-name.
```
```sh
Create a Pull Request: Create a new pull request by navigating to the original repository on the hosting 
platform and clicking the "New pull request" button. Select your fork and branch from the dropdown menus and 
fill in the necessary information, such as the description of the changes and any related issues or pull requests.
```
```sh
Collaborate and Improve: Once the pull request is created, Exigent, the maintainers of the original repository
will review your changes and provide feedback. Collaborate with Exigent to improve your changes until they
are ready to be merged into the main branch.
```
```sh
Keep Your Fork Updated: It is a good practice to keep your fork up-to-date with the changes made to the 
original repository. mYou can do this by adding the original repository as an upstream remote and pulling
the changes from there.
```
```sh
Git clone 
```
```sh
Cd front-end-developer-test
```
```sh
Npm install
```
```sh
Node api/mock.js to open your mock api on  http://localhost:3000/todos
```
Read the api documentation in api/apiDoc.txt for CRUD endpoints.

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

### You need to code this design using the following architecture (This has been setup for you just clone the repo and npm install): 

* VueJS 3 - options api or composition api
* Pinia - Global state management
* Vue Router - for navigation, nested dynamic routes, route guarding, 404 page
* TailwindCSS - for CSS
* localStorage - to persist the data
* Axios - For API calls
* ExpressJS - Mock DB to test CRUD capability and Authentication of app

### Your code should include the following:

* Comments
* Higher order components to make code reusable
* Responsivity for all screen sizes
* Push often and regularly

### As a bonus (not required):

* Typescript
* Unit Testing
