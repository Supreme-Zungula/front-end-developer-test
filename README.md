npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh

### You need to code this design using the following architecture (This has been setup for you just clone the repo and npm install): 

* VueJS 3 - options api or composition api
* Pinia - Global state management
* Vue Router - for navigation, nested dynamic routes, route guarding, 404 page
* TailwindCSS - for CSS
* localStorage - to persist the data
* Axios - For API calls
* ExpressJS - Mock DB to test CRUD capability and Authentication of app

### Your code should include the following:

* Comments
* Higher order components to make code reusable
* Responsivity for all screen sizes
* Push often and regularly

### As a bonus (not required):

* Typescript
* Unit Testing
